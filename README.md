# Web-Developement-Books
## Best chosen and filtered books for full stack web development!
#### If you're a beginner in web development world, then this repository can same huge amount of time which you may waste by searching them on the web. That's why I've created this repo and hoping that someone, at someday might get helped from this. I don't own any of these books and use at your own risk (copyright risk if you use them for commercial purposes).

#### Also I've added books in segments (folders) which has been named "Preferred". Those books I personally recommend for web development. But if you're not interested in them, then you're welcome too! If you need something more, FORK ME!

### Good luck and happy coding. Love from Bangladesh. --Rafi
